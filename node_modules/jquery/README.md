# jQuery

> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library.

For information on how to get started and how to use jQuery, please see [jQuery's documentation](https://api.jquery.com/).
For source files and issues, please visit the [jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery).

If upgrading, please see the [blog post for 3.7.1](https://blog.jquery.com/2023/08/28/jquery-3-7-1-released-reliable-table-row-dimensions/). This includes notable differences from the previous version and a more readable changelog.

## Including jQuery

Below are some of the most common ways to include jQuery.

### Browser

#### Script tag

```html
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js"></script>
```

#### Webpack / Browserify / Babel

There are several ways to use [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). For more information on using these tools, please refer to the corresponding project's documentation. In the script, including jQuery will usually look like this:

```js
import $ from "jquery";
```

If you need to use jQuery in a file that's not an ECMAScript module, you can use the CommonJS syntax:

```js
var $ = require( "jquery" );
```

#### AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition)

AMD is a module format built for the browser. For more information, we recommend [require.js' documentation](https://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html).

```js
define( [ "jquery" ], function( $ ) {

} );
```

### Node

To include jQuery in [Node](https://nodejs.org/), first install with npm.

```sh
npm install jquery
```

For jQuery to work in Node, a window with a document is required. Since no such window exists natively in Node, one can be mocked by tools such as [jsdom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom). This can be useful for testing purposes.

```js
const { JSDOM } = require( "jsdom" );
const { window } = new JSDOM( "" );
const $ = require( "jquery" )( window );
```
