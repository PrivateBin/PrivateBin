modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide

been advised of the possibility of such damages.

#### 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability

While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to
offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or
other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree to be
bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons Attribution 4.0
International Public License ("Public License"). To the extent this Public
License may be interpreted as a contract, You are granted the Licensed Rights in
consideration of Your acceptance of these terms and conditions, and the Licensor
grants You such rights in consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from
making the Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.

### Section 1 – Definitions.

a. __Adapted Material__ means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the
Licensed Material is translated, altered, arranged, transformed, or otherwise
modified in a manner requiring permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights
held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording, Adapted Material is
always produced where the Licensed Material is synched in timed relation with a
moving image.

b. __Adapter's License__ means the license You apply to Your Copyright and
Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in accordance with the
terms and conditions of this Public License.

c. __Copyright and Similar Rights__ means copyright and/or similar rights
closely related to copyright including, without limitation, performance,
broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database Rights, without regard to
how the rights are labeled or categorized. For purposes of this Public License,
the rights specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar Rights.

d. __Effective Technological Measures__ means those measures that, in the
absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws fulfilling
obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright Treaty adopted on December
20, 1996, and/or similar international agreements.

e. __Exceptions and Limitations__ means fair use, fair dealing, and/or any other
exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights that applies to Your use
of the Licensed Material.

f. __Licensed Material__ means the artistic or literary work, database, or other
material to which the Licensor applied this Public License.

g. __Licensed Rights__ means the rights granted to You subject to the terms and
conditions of this Public License, which are limited to all Copyright and
Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the Licensed Material and that the
Licensor has authority to license.

h. __Licensor__ means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights under
this Public License.

i. __Share__ means to provide material to the public by any means or process
that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such as reproduction, public
display, public performance, distribution, dissemination, communication, or
importation, and to make material available to the public including in ways that
members of the public may access the material from a place and at a time
individually chosen by them.

j. __Sui Generis Database Rights__ means rights other than copyright resulting
from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March
1996 on the legal protection of databases, as amended and/or succeeded, as well
as other essentially equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

k. __You__ means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights under
this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

### Section 2 – Scope.

a. ___License grant.___

    1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License, the Licensor
       hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-sublicensable,
       non-exclusive, irrevocable license to exercise the Licensed Rights in the
       Licensed Material to:

        A. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or in part; and

        B. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

    2. __Exceptions and Limitations.__ For the avoidance of doubt, where
       Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public License does
       not apply, and You do not need to comply with its terms and conditions.

    3. __Term.__ The term of this Public License is specified in Section 6(a).

    4. __Media and formats; technical modifications allowed.__ The Licensor
       authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in all media and formats
       whether now known or hereafter created, and to make technical
       modifications necessary to do so. The Licensor waives and/or agrees not
       to assert any right or authority to forbid You from making technical
       modifications necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
       technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective Technological
       Measures. For purposes of this Public License, simply making
       modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)(4) never produces Adapted
       Material.

    5. __Downstream recipients.__

        A. __Offer from the Licensor – Licensed Material.__ Every recipient of
           the Licensed Material automatically receives an offer from the
           Licensor to exercise the Licensed Rights under the terms and
           conditions of this Public License.

        B. __No downstream restrictions.__ You may not offer or impose any
           additional or different terms or conditions on, or apply any
           Effective Technological Measures to, the Licensed Material if doing
           so restricts exercise of the Licensed Rights by any recipient of the
           Licensed Material.

    6. __No endorsement.__ Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be
       construed as permission to assert or imply that You are, or that Your use
       of the Licensed Material is, connected with, or sponsored, endorsed, or
       granted official status by, the Licensor or others designated to receive
       attribution as provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

b. ___Other rights.___

    1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not licensed under this
       Public License, nor are publicity, privacy, and/or other similar
       personality rights; however, to the extent possible, the Licensor waives
       and/or agrees not to assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the
       limited extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed Rights,
       but not otherwise.

    2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this Public License.

    3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to collect
       royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed Rights, whether
       directly or through a collecting society under any voluntary or waivable
       statutory or compulsory licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor
       expressly reserves any right to collect such royalties.

### Section 3 – License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the following
conditions.

a. ___Attribution.___

    1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified form), You must:

        A. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor with the
           Licensed Material:

            i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed Material and any
               others designated to receive attribution, in any reasonable
               manner requested by the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
               designated);

            ii. a copyright notice;

            iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

            iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of warranties;

            v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the extent
               reasonably practicable;

        B. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and retain an
           indication of any previous modifications; and

        C. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this Public License,
           and include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, this Public
           License.

    2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any reasonable
       manner based on the medium, means, and context in which You Share the
       Licensed Material. For example, it may be reasonable to satisfy the
       conditions by providing a URI or hyperlink to a resource that includes
       the required information.

    3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the information
       required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent reasonably practicable.

    4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's License You
       apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted Material from complying
       with this Public License.

### Section 4 – Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that apply to Your
use of the Licensed Material:

a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right to extract,
   reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial portion of the contents of
   the database;

b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database contents in a
   database in which You have Sui Generis Database Rights, then the database in
   which You have Sui Generis Database Rights (but not its individual contents)
   is Adapted Material; and

c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share all or a
   substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not replace Your
obligations under this Public License where the Licensed Rights include other
Copyright and Similar Rights.

### Section 5 – Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

a. __Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the extent
   possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and as-available,
   and makes no representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
   Licensed Material, whether express, implied, statutory, or other. This
   includes, without limitation, warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
   for a particular purpose, non-infringement, absence of latent or other
   defects, accuracy, or the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known
   or discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full or
   in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.__

b. __To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to You on
   any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence) or otherwise for
   any direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential, punitive,
   exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses, or damages arising out of this
   Public License or use of the Licensed Material, even if the Licensor has been
   advised of the possibility of such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where
   a limitation of liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation
   may not apply to You.__

c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided above shall
   be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible, most closely
   approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all liability.

### Section 6 – Term and Termination.

a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar Rights
   licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public License, then
   Your rights under this Public License terminate automatically.

b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under Section
   6(a), it reinstates:

    1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it is cured
       within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or

    2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any right the
    Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations of this Public
    License.

c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed Material
   under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the Licensed Material
   at any time; however, doing so will not terminate this Public License.

d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public License.

### Section 7 – Other Terms and Conditions.

a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different terms or
   conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the Licensed
   Material not stated herein are separate from and independent of the terms and
   conditions of this Public License.

### Section 8 – Interpretation.

a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall not be
   interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions on any use of
   the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made without permission under
   this Public License.

b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is deemed
   unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the minimum extent
   necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision cannot be reformed, it
   shall be severed from this Public License without affecting the
   enforceability of the remaining terms and conditions.

c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no failure to
   comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the Licensor.

d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted as a
   limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities that apply to
   the Licensor or You, including from the legal processes of any jurisdiction
   or authority.
