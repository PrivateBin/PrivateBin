[main]
; (optional) set a project name to be displayed on the website
; name = "PrivateBin"

; The full URL, with the domain name and directories that point to the
; PrivateBin files, including an ending slash (/). This URL is essential to
; allow Opengraph images to be displayed on social networks.
; basepath = "https://privatebin.example.com/"

; enable or disable the discussion feature, defaults to true
discussion = true

; preselect the discussion feature, defaults to false
opendiscussion = false

; enable or disable the display of dates & times in the comments, defaults to true
; Note that internally the creation time will still get tracked in order to sort
; the comments by creation time, but you can choose not to display them.
; discussiondatedisplay = false

; enable or disable the password feature, defaults to true
password = true

; enable or disable the file upload feature, defaults to false
fileupload = false

; preselect the burn-after-reading feature, defaults to false
burnafterreadingselected = false

; which display mode to preselect by default, defaults to "plaintext"
; make sure the value exists in [formatter_options]
defaultformatter = "plaintext"

; (optional) set a syntax highlighting theme, as found in css/prettify/
; syntaxhighlightingtheme = "sons-of-obsidian"

; size limit per paste or comment in bytes, defaults to 10 Mebibytes
sizelimit = 10485760

; by default PrivateBin use "bootstrap" template (tpl/bootstrap.php).
; Optionally you can enable the template selection menu, which uses
; a session cookie to store the choice until the browser is closed.
templateselection = false

; List of available for selection templates when "templateselection" option is enabled
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap"
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap-page"
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap-dark"
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap-dark-page"
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap-compact"
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap-compact-page"
availabletemplates[] = "bootstrap5"
availabletemplates[] = "page"

; set the template your installs defaults to, defaults to "bootstrap" (tpl/bootstrap.php), also
; available are "page" (tpl/page.php), the classic ZeroBin style and several
; bootstrap variants: "bootstrap-dark", "bootstrap-compact", "bootstrap-page",
; which can be combined with "-dark" and "-compact" for "bootstrap-dark-page",
; "bootstrap-compact-page" and finally "bootstrap5" (tpl/bootstrap5.php) - previews at:
; https://privatebin.info/screenshots.html
; template = "bootstrap"

; (optional) info text to display
; use single, instead of double quotes for HTML attributes
;info = "More information on the <a href='https://privatebin.info/'>project page</a>."

; (optional) notice to display
; notice = "Note: This is a test service: Data may be deleted anytime. Kittens will die if you abuse this service."

; by default PrivateBin will guess the visitors language based on the browsers
; settings. Optionally you can enable the language selection menu, which uses
; a session cookie to store the choice until the browser is closed.
languageselection = false

; set the language your installs defaults to, defaults to English
; if this is set and language selection is disabled, this will be the only language
; languagedefault = "en"

; (optional) URL shortener address to offer after a new paste is created.
; It is suggested to only use this with self-hosted shorteners as this will leak
; the pastes encryption key.
; urlshortener = "https://shortener.example.com/api?link="

; (optional) Let users create a QR code for sharing the paste URL with one click.
; It works both when a new paste is created and when you view a paste.
; qrcode = true

; (optional) Let users send an email sharing the paste URL with one click.
; It works both when a new paste is created and when you view a paste.
; email = true

; (optional) IP based icons are a weak mechanism to detect if a comment was from
; a different user when the same username was used in a comment. It might get
; used to get the IP of a comment poster if the server salt is leaked and a
; SHA512 HMAC rainbow table is generated for all (relevant) IPs.
; Can be set to one these values:
; "none" / "identicon" (default) / "jdenticon" / "vizhash".
; icon = "none"

; Content Security Policy headers allow a website to restrict what sources are
; allowed to be accessed in its context. You need to change this if you added
; custom scripts from third-party domains to your templates, e.g. tracking
; scripts or run your site behind certain DDoS-protection services.
; Check the documentation at https://content-security-policy.com/
; Notes:
; - If you use any bootstrap theme, you can remove the allow-popups from the
;   sandbox restrictions.
; - If you use the bootstrap5 theme, you must change default-src to 'self' to
;   enable display of the svg icons
; - By default this disallows to load images from third-party servers, e.g. when
;   they are embedded in pastes. If you wish to allow that, you can adjust the
;   policy here. See https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/FAQ#why-does-not-it-load-embedded-images
;   for details.
; - The 'wasm-unsafe-eval' is used to enable webassembly support (used for zlib
;   compression). You can remove it if compression doesn't need to be supported.
; - The 'unsafe-inline' style-src is used by Chrome when displaying PDF previews
;   and can be omitted if attachment upload is disabled (which is the default).
;   See https://issues.chromium.org/issues/343754409
; - To allow displaying PDF previews in Firefox or Chrome, sandboxing must also
;   get turned off. The following CSP allows PDF previews:
; cspheader = "default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'none'; manifest-src 'self'; connect-src * blob:; script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; font-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; frame-src blob:; img-src 'self' data: blob:; media-src blob:; object-src blob:"
;
; The recommended and default used CSP is:
; cspheader = "default-src 'none'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'none'; manifest-src 'self'; connect-src * blob:; script-src 'self' 'wasm-unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; frame-ancestors 'none'; frame-src blob:; img-src 'self' data: blob:; media-src blob:; object-src blob:; sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-modals allow-downloads"

; stay compatible with PrivateBin Alpha 0.19, less secure
; if enabled will use base64.js version 1.7 instead of 2.1.9 and sha1 instead of
; sha256 in HMAC for the deletion token
; zerobincompatibility = false

; Enable or disable the warning message when the site is served over an insecure
; connection (insecure HTTP instead of HTTPS), defaults to true.
; Secure transport methods like Tor and I2P domains are automatically whitelisted.
; It is **strongly discouraged** to disable this.
; See https://github.com/PrivateBin/PrivateBin/wiki/FAQ#why-does-it-show-me-an-error-about-an-insecure-connection for more information.
; httpwarning = true

; Pick compression algorithm or disable it. Only applies to pastes/comments
; created after changing the setting.
; Can be set to one these values: "none" / "zlib" (default).
; compression = "zlib"

; be exempted, the list needs to be comma separated. Leave unset to disable
; exemptions.
; exempted = "1.2.3.4,10.10.10/24"

; (optional) If you want only some source IP addresses (v4 or v6) or subnets
; (CIDR) to be allowed to create pastes, set these here. Invalid IPs will be
; ignored. If multiple values are to be exempted, the list needs to be comma
; separated. Leave unset to allow anyone to create pastes.
; creators = "1.2.3.4,10.10.10/24"

; (optional) if your website runs behind a reverse proxy or load balancer,
; set the HTTP header containing the visitors IP address, i.e. X_FORWARDED_FOR
; header = "X_FORWARDED_FOR"

; minimum time limit between two purgings of expired pastes, it is only
; triggered when pastes are created
; Set this to 0 to run a purge every time a paste is created.

; Set this to 0 to disable purging. Set it higher, if you are running a large

;[yourls]
; When using YOURLS as a "urlshortener" config item:
; - By default, "urlshortener" will point to the YOURLS API URL, with or without
;   credentials, and will be visible in public on the PrivateBin web page.
;   Only use this if you allow short URL creation without credentials.
; - Alternatively, using the parameters in this section ("signature" and
;   "apiurl"), "urlshortener" needs to point to the base URL of your PrivateBin
;   instance with "?shortenviayourls&link=" appended. For example:
;   urlshortener = "${basepath}?shortenviayourls&link="
;   This URL will in turn call YOURLS on the server side, using the URL from
;   "apiurl" and the "access signature" from the "signature" parameters below.

; (optional) the "signature" (access key) issued by YOURLS for the using account
; signature = ""
